This repository contains a part of my final project in my DevOps course in which I was assigned to:
1.	Build a running JSP website and upload the site to GitHub
2.	Operate a Linux VM and pull Jenkins and Tomcat Docker image
3.	Create a directory and using volume mapping run, start, and, config  Jenkins and Tomcat containers
4.	In Jenkins: deploy the Website into a production environment and use 2 separate monitors to monitor the site availability if the site is down it should trigger the build job to give an "emergency response". 
5.	Make a change in the GitHub repo and check if the Website responded as it should.
